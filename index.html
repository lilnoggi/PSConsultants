            <h3>About Rob</h3>
            <p>As a strategic-thinking CFO, I have extensive experience leading and expanding group finance organisations for well-established international companies in Professional Services, Retail, E-commerce, and Private Equity.
Throughout my 20+ global finance career, I have built solid success in creating and executing strategic financial plans, as well as instituting robust financial governance structures to expand high-growth businesses and bolster financial profitability.
As a highly-regarded Board-level Finance Executive Leader, I have informed and shaped the strategic decision-making process on mergers and acquisitions, investment selection, business restructuring, and profit optimization.
With a proven track record of success as a Business Transformation Leader, I have executed company-wide/ group-wide change management and restructuring plans to return businesses to profitability or to prepare them for IPO/Sale, Mergers, Acquisition, and Integration, or BPO/Shared Services establishments.</p>

                    <p>“I worked with Robert as part of the senior team at DEGW (Project Space UK) involved in a turnaround project.  I found Robert to be an accomplished GFD, with not just an excellent understanding of finance and business modelling, but also the knack of being able to interpret complex financial concepts in an approachable way for non-financial managers. I would not hesitate to recommend Robert.”</p>
